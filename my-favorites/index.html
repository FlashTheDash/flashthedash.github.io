		<div class='favorites-list'>
			<h2>Youtube Channels</h2>
			<ol class='list'>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>Bill Wurtz</li>
				<p>You might know him for his "History of Japan" video. In addition to his two longer videos, he's made a lot of shorter videos, all focused around a bit of music he's made.</p>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>Red Means Recording</li>
				<p>This channel shows the process of making music on a synthesizer, but edited down so there's no boring parts. I don't know why, but I find the videos to be very relaxing</p>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>Simone Giertz</li>
				<p>She makes bad robots on purpose. They're actually pretty funny.</p>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class='favorites-list'>
			<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
			<ol class='list'>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>Python</li>
				<p>I love python! The main downside is that it isn't compiled, so it can run slowly.</p>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>HTML/CSS</li>
				<p>I wasn't a big fan of either until I did this project, but they're starting to grow on me.  It's awesome to see a website slowly emerge as I work on it.</p>
				<li class='favorites-list-item'>JavaScript</li>
				<p>I don't know much about this language, but I hope to learn it and make this site more responsive or make a react-native app.</p>
